**fig6f**
Figure 6F shows the swarm fraction in the light of 64 morphobots of either aligners (cyan) or fronters (green). Each curve represents the mean of 4 runs, with the error bar being the standard error. Individual locations of all robots are found in the folders **aligners**, or **fronters**.


**fig7g**
Figure 7G shows the swarm fraction in the light of a learning swarm of 64 morphobots of either aligners (cyan) or fronters (green). Each curve represents the mean of 4 runs, with the error bar being the standard error. Mean and error data are found in *frontersInLight.csv* and *alignersInLight.csv*. Individual locations of all robots are found in the folders **aligners**, or **fronters**.
