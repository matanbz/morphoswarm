### Folder structure

##### Data
**data**

The data for generating the figures in the manuscript is found under the following subfolders:

**fig6f**
Data files from individual experiments for each curve in Figure 6F are found under the folder corresponding to the robot type (either **aligners**, or **fronters**).

**fig6g**
Data files from individual simulations for each curve in Figure 6G are found under the folder corresponding to the robot type (either **aligners**, or **fronters**), under the relevant swarm size (**64**, **128**, **256**, **512**).

**fig7g**
Data files from individual experiments for each curve in Figure 7G are found under the folder corresponding to the robot type (either **aligners**, or **fronters**).

**fig7h**
Data files from individual simulations for each curve in Figure 7H are found under the folder corresponding to the robot type (either **aligners**, or **fronters**), under the relevant swarm size (**64**, **128**, **256**, **512**).

##### Code
**code**

The code for simulating a swarm of force-aligning agents that collectively learn to phototaxis.
In order to run the simulation use:

```python runSimulation.py```
