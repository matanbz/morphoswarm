### Folder structure
The data for generating the figures in the manuscript is found in under directory **data** with the following subfolders:


**fig6f**
Data files from individual experiments for each curve in Figure 6F are found under the folder corresponding to the robot type (either **aligners, or **fronters**).

**fig6g**
Data files from individual simulations for each curve in Figure 6G are found under the folder corresponding to the robot type (either **aligners, or **fronters**), under the relevant swarm size (**64**, **128**, **256**, **512**).


**fig7g**
Data files from individual experiments for each curve in Figure 7G are found under the folder corresponding to the robot type (either **aligners, or **fronters**).

**fig7h**
Data files from individual simulations for each curve in Figure 7H are found under the folder corresponding to the robot type (either **aligners, or **fronters**), under the relevant swarm size (**64**, **128**, **256**, **512**).
